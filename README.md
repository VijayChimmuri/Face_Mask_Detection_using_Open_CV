OpenCV is an open-source library which is primarily used for Computer Vision Applications. This contains many functions and algorithms for Motion tracking, Facial recognition, Object Detection, Segmentation and recognition and many other applications. Images and real time video streams can be manipulated to suit different needs using this library.


There are no efficient face mask detection applications to detect weather the person is wearing face mask or not. This increases the demand for an efficient system for detecting face masks on people for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. This project uses machine learning classification using OpenCV and Tensorflow to detect facemasks on peoples.
